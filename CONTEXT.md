# Context Summary

## Work Completed This Session

### Major Achievements - v2.3 Release
- **Implemented v2.3 work days scoring system** with progressive penalty algorithm
- **Modified work days standard** from 8-10 days to single 10-day standard
- **Created progressive penalty algorithm** with escalating penalties for sub-standard performance
- **Added comprehensive test suite** (test_work_days_scoring_v23.py) validating all scenarios
- **Updated all version references** from v2.1 to v2.3 throughout codebase
- **Maintained backward compatibility** for bonus calculations above 10 days

### Files Modified/Added This Session
- `scoring.py` - Core performance evaluation system (updated to v2.3)
  - ScoringConfig parameters updated for 10-day standard
  - Added calculate_progressive_penalty() method
  - Completely rewrote calculate_work_days_score() function
  - Updated all version information and output messages
- `test_work_days_scoring_v23.py` - New comprehensive test suite
  - Tests all work day scoring scenarios (5-25 days)
  - Validates progressive penalty algorithm mathematically
  - Shows comparative scoring examples with comprehensive scores
- `TASK.md` - Updated task completion status
- `CONTEXT.md` - Updated session progress summary

### Key Technical Features Implemented
- **Progressive Penalty Algorithm**: `base_penalty × (multiplier)^(gap-1) × gap`
  - More severe penalties as distance from 10-day standard increases
  - Implements management directive for performance accountability
- **Single Standard Model**: 10 days = 100 points (only perfect score)
  - Eliminates previous 8-10 day range for clearer expectations
  - Maintains existing bonus structure for >10 day performance
- **Enhanced Test Coverage**: Comprehensive validation across all scenarios
  - Mathematical verification of penalty calculations
  - Comparative analysis with comprehensive scoring system

## Technical Decisions Made

### Algorithm Design Strategy
- **Progressive Penalty Approach**: Chose exponential penalty increase over linear
  - Formula: `base_penalty × (multiplier^(gap-1)) × gap`
  - Parameters: base_penalty_rate=5, progressive_multiplier=1.2
  - Rationale: Stronger management signal for significant underperformance
- **Parameter Optimization**: Balanced penalty severity with fairness
  - 5-day baseline penalty: ~52 points (C-grade threshold)
  - 6-day penalty: ~35 points (manageable but noticeable)
  - 9-day penalty: ~5 points (minor adjustment zone)

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- **Maintained Bonus Structure**: All >10 day calculations unchanged
- **Preserved API**: No breaking changes to public methods
- **Version Increment**: Clear v2.3 versioning for feature tracking
- **Test Coverage**: Ensured all existing functionality still works
